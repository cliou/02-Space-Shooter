This mission is to go to a planet unknown to us and there may be meteorites smashing into the ship all around, so please be careful. 
The unknown planet holds lifeforms, hopefully they are friendly and will not come to attack us. 
But we also must make safety preparations, and if they attack us, we have other options, which is to shoot them down. 

I hope you have fun working on this mission and the reward will be credited to your account upon completion. "
